"""Post-process RecompiledFuncs: chain truncated overlapping functions.

N64Recomp truncates a function's decode at the next function symbol in the same
section, WITHOUT emitting the fall-through. Overlapping IDO mid-entries (our
extra_funcs additions for cross-overlay shared tails) therefore become "stumps":
a few instructions, then the C body just ends -- returning early without the
original tail (skipping logic AND the stack restore; this class caused the
boot84 saved-s0 corruption).

For every RECOMP_FUNC body whose END is REACHABLE (control flow can fall off
the closing brace), look up the same-section function starting at (last decoded
address + 4) and append a tail-call to it. Run after every tools/recomp_loop.py
invocation (see CLAUDE.md build loop).

Reachability, not "does the tail contain a return": the match-exit -0x18 stack
leak (boot91, session 7) was func_80009B7C, whose truncated fall-off sits right
AFTER a label (L_80009BEC) that follows another exit path's `return;` -- the old
last-8-lines heuristic saw that return and skipped the stump. Rule: walk the
body at brace depth 0; `return;`/`goto` kill the flow, any label revives it
(labels are goto targets); if the flow is alive at the closing brace, the
function falls off the end and must be chained.
